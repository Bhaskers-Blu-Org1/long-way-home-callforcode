# long-way-home-callforcode
This Repo houses the Long way home Application, which was developed as part of the Call For Code competition.   The long way home application attempts to re-unit aid seekers with family members / guardians using facial recognition technology. It provides a platform in which family members may upload pictures and information of a missing loved one, in conjunction, an aid worker can upload the image of an aid seeker and be shown those missing persons posts that most resemble them. The Aid worker can then use the contact information provided to organize a re-uniting.
